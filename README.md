# Poetry Interpretation Corpus

A large-scale corpus of poems paired with structured interpretations, created for computational analysis of poetic 
meaning and literary interpretation in the digital humanities. I'm testing the link. 

## Overview

This corpus combines two major public poetry datasets and augments them with AI-generated structured interpretations 
using ChatGPT. The resulting dataset enables research at the intersection of computational linguistics, literary 
studies, and artificial intelligence, particularly for tasks such as:

- Poetry understanding and analysis
- Interpretive text generation
- Literary meaning extraction
- Cross-referencing human and machine interpretation of poetry
- Training and evaluating language models on literary analysis

## Source Corpora

### 1. Poetry Foundation Corpus
- **Source**: [Poetry Foundation Poems Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tgdivy/poetry-foundation-poems/data)
- **Size**: 13,854 poems
- **Description**: High-quality contemporary and historical poetry from Poetry Foundation's extensive digital archive
- **Coverage**: Wide range of poets, styles, and historical periods

### 2. Public Domain Poetry Corpus
- **Source**: [Public Domain Poetry Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DanFosing/public-domain-poetry)
- **Size**: 38,499 poems
- **Description**: Poems in the public domain, representing classical and historical poetry
- **Coverage**: Predominantly works published before copyright restrictions

### Combined Dataset Statistics
- **Total unique entries**: 51,356 poems
- **Fixed splits**: 90% train / 5% validation / 5% test

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Integration
1. **Source Integration**: Combined Poetry Foundation and Public Domain Poetry datasets
2. **Deduplication**: Removed duplicate entries based on matching author and title fields
3. **Quality Control**: Preserved original metadata and text formatting

### Interpretation Generation
Structured interpretations were generated using ChatGPT (`gpt-4o-2024-05-13`) through a systematic prompting approach:

1. **Prompt Design**: Carefully crafted prompts to elicit structured literary analysis
2. **Processing Pipeline**: Automated batch processing of poems through the OpenAI API
3. **Interpretation Structure**: Each interpretation includes:
   - Thematic analysis
   - Literary device identification
   - Historical/cultural context
   - Emotional tone and mood
   - Structural observations

## Dataset Structure

Each entry in the corpus contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `author` | string | Name of the poem's author |
| `title` | string | Title of the poem |
| `poem` | string | Full text of the poem |
| `interpretation` | string | AI-generated structured interpretation |
| `source` | string | Origin dataset identifier (`poetry_foundation` or `public_domain_poetry`) |

## Usage

### Loading the Dataset

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("haining/structured_poem_interpretation_corpus")
```

## Research Applications

This corpus enables several research directions:

### 1. Computational Literary Analysis
- Automated poetry interpretation systems
- Comparative analysis of interpretive approaches (human vs. machine)
- Pattern recognition in literary analysis
- Evaluating AI's capacity for literary understanding
- Human-AI collaboration in literary criticism
- Benchmarking language models on interpretive tasks

## Limitations and Considerations

### AI-Generated Interpretations
- Interpretations are generated by AI and may not capture the full depth of human literary analysis
- Should be used as a starting point or complement to, not replacement for, expert literary criticism
- May reflect biases present in the training data of the generation model

### Dataset Composition
- Predominantly English-language poetry
- Historical bias toward Western literary traditions
- Potential copyright considerations for more recent works

### Quality Variability
- Interpretation quality may vary across poems of different styles and complexity
- Obscure or highly experimental poems may receive less accurate interpretations
